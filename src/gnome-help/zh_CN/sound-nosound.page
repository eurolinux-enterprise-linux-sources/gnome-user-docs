<title>不能听到计算机上的任何声音</title>

  <p>If you cannot hear any sounds on your computer, for example when you try
  to play music, try these troubleshooting steps to see if you can fix the
  problem.</p>

<section id="mute">
  <title>确保声音没有被“静音”</title>

  <p>Open the <gui xref="shell-terminology">system menu</gui> from the right
  side of the top bar and make sure that the sound is not muted or turned right
  down.</p>

  <p>一些笔记本电脑在键盘上有一个静音切换键——试着按一下看看能否听到声音。</p>

  <p>You should also check that you have not muted the application that you are
  using to play sound (for example, your music player or movie player). The
  application may have a mute or volume button in its main window, so check
  that. Also, open <app>Settings</app> from the <gui>Activities</gui> overview
  and click <gui>Sound</gui>. Go to the <gui>Applications</gui> tab and check
  that your application is not muted.</p>

</section>

<section id="speakers">
 <title>检查音箱电源打开，并且连接正确</title>
 <p>If your computer has external speakers, make sure that they are turned on
 and that the volume is turned up. Make sure that the speaker cable is securely
 plugged into the "output" audio socket on your computer. This socket
 is usually light green in color.</p>

 <p>一些声卡可以切换输出(到音箱)和输入(例如从麦克风)，在运行 Linux、Windows、Mac OS 时，输出插孔可能是不同的，试着将音频线在各个音频插孔中都试试，看看它是否能出声。</p>

 <p>最后检查一下音频线是否正确地插入音量的插孔，一些音箱有多个输入插孔。</p>
</section>

<section id="device">
  <title>检查是否选择了正确的声音设备</title>

  <p>一些计算机装有多个“声音设备”，其中，有些是声音声音输出，有些则不是，因此，您应当检查是否选择了正确的设备，通过多次试验，选择出正确的一个来。</p>

  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Open the <gui xref="shell-terminology">Activities</gui> overview and
      start typing <gui>Sound</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click on <gui>Sound</gui> to open the panel.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>In the <gui>Output</gui> tab. Make a note of which device and which
      profile are selected (so you can return to the default selections if
      changing them does not work).</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>要选择一个设备，试着更改配置——改完后播放一段声音，看看它是否能正常工作。您可能要挨个试里面的设备。</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>If that does not work, you might want to try doing the same for any
      other devices that are listed.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>

</section>

<section id="hardware-detected">

 <title>检查声卡已经正确检测到</title>

  <p>Your sound card may not have been detected properly. If this has happened,
  your computer will think that it is not able to play sound. A possible reason
  for the card not being detected properly is that the drivers for the card are
  not installed. You may need to manually install the drivers for the card.
  How you do this will depend on the card you have.</p>

  <p>You can see what sound card you have by using the <cmd>lspci</cmd> command
  in the Terminal. Go to the <gui>Activities</gui> overview and open a Terminal.
  You may have to run <cmd>lspci</cmd> as
  <link xref="user-admin-explain">superuser</link>; either type
  <cmd>sudo lspci</cmd> and type your password, or type <cmd>su</cmd>, enter
  the <em>root</em> (administrative) password, then type <cmd>lspci</cmd>. See
  if an <em>audio controller</em> or <em>audio device</em> is listed—it should
  have the make and model number of the sound card. <cmd>lspci -v</cmd> will
  show a list with more detailed information.</p>

  <p>You may be able to find and install drivers for your card. It is best to
  ask on support forums (or otherwise) for your Linux distribution for
  instructions.</p>

  <p>If you cannot get drivers for your sound card, you might prefer to buy a
  new sound card. You can get sound cards that can be installed inside the
  computer and external USB sound cards.</p>
