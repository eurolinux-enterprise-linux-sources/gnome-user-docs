  <p>More links would be good, especially in #logout. Could go final
  as-is. Incomplete for now</p>

  <p>When you've finished using your computer, you can turn it off, suspend it
 (to save power), or leave it powered on and log out.</p>

<section id="logout">
<title>Log out or switch users</title>
  <p>To let other users use your computer, you can either log out, or leave
  yourself logged in and just switch users. If you switch users, all of
  your applications will continue running, and everything will be where you
  left it when you log back in.</p>
  <p>To <gui>Log Out</gui> or <gui>Switch User</gui>, click your name on the
  top bar and select the appropriate option.</p>

<note if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">
  <p>The <gui>Log Out</gui> and <gui>Switch User</gui> entries only appear in
  the menu if you have more than one user account on your system.</p>

<title>Lock the screen</title>
  <p>If you're leaving your computer for a short time, you should lock your
  screen to prevent other people from accessing your files or running
  applications. When you return, raise the
  <link xref="shell-lockscreen">lock screen</link> curtain and enter your
  password to log back in. If you don't lock your screen, it will lock
  automatically after a certain amount of time.</p>

  <p>To lock your screen, click your name on the top bar and select
  <gui>Lock</gui>.</p>

  <p>When your screen is locked, other users can log in to their own accounts
  by clicking <gui>Log in as another user</gui> on the password screen. You
  can switch back to your desktop when they are finished.</p>

<title>Suspend</title>

  <p>To save power, suspend your computer when you are not using it. If you use
  a laptop, GNOME suspends your computer automatically when you close the lid.
  This saves your state to your computer's memory and powers off most of the
  computer's functions. A very small amount of power is still used during
  suspend.</p>

  <p>To suspend your computer manually, click your name on the top bar and
  hold down the <key>Alt</key> key. The <gui>Power Off</gui> option will
  change to <gui>Suspend</gui>. Select <gui>Suspend</gui>.</p>

</section>

<section id="shutdown">
<!--<info>
  <link type="seealso" xref="power-off"/>
</info>-->
<title>Power off or restart</title>

  <p>If you want to power off your computer entirely, or do a full restart,
  click your name on the top bar and select <gui>Power Off</gui>. A dialog will
  open offering you to either <gui>Restart</gui> or <gui>Power Off</gui>.</p>

  <p>If there are other users logged in, you may not be allowed to
  power off or restart the computer, because this will end their sessions.
  If you are an administrative user, you may be asked for your password
  to power off.</p>

<note style="tip">
  <p>You may want to power off your computer if you wish to move it and do not
  have a battery, if your battery is low or does not hold charge well. A powered
  off computer also uses <link xref="power-batterylife">less energy</link> than
  one which is suspended.</p>
