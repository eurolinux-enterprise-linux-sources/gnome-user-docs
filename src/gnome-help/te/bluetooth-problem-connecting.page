<title>నేను నా బ్లూటూత్ పరికరాన్ని అనుసంధానించలేకపోతున్నాను</title>

<p>There are a number of reasons why you may not be able to connect to a Bluetooth device,
such as a phone or headset.</p>

    <title>అనుసంధానం నిరోధించబడినది లేక నమ్మదగినదికాదు</title>
    <p>Some Bluetooth devices block connections by default, or require you to change
    a setting to allow connections to be made. Make sure that your device is set
    up to allow connections.</p>

    <title>Bluetooth hardware not recognized</title>
    <p>Your Bluetooth adapter/dongle may not have been recognized by the computer.
    This could be because <link xref="hardware-driver">drivers</link> for the
    adapter aren't installed. Some Bluetooth adapters aren't supported on Linux,
    so you may not be able to get the right drivers for them. In this case, you
    will probably have to get a different Bluetooth adapter.</p>
