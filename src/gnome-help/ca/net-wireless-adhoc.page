<title>Create a wireless hotspot</title>

<p>You can use your computer as a wireless hotspot. This allows other devices to
connect to you without a separate network, and allows you to share an internet
connection you've made with another interface, such as to a wired network or
over the cellular network.</p>

<p>Things I'm not sure about: Is this actually ad-hoc? It seems to use the
same icon. What happens if you have multiple wireless adapters? Ought to be
able to share wireless to wireless, I think, but I don't know what the UI
looks like. Also, does any of this work? I couldn't successfully test.</p>
<p>Also, looks like there's no page to set the device name. Make one, then
link below where it says the name of the network is your device name.</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>Feu clic a la icona de xarxa del quadre superior i seleccioneu <gui>Paràmetres de xarxa</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Seleccioneu <gui>Sense fil</gui> a l'esquerra.</p></item>
  <item><p>Feu clic al botó <gui>Utilitza com a Hotspot...</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>If you are already connected to a wireless network, you will be asked
  if you want to disconnect from that network. A single wireless adapter can only
  connect to or create one network at a time. Click <gui>Create Hotspot</gui> to
  confirm.</p></item>
</steps>

<p>A network name (SSID) and security key are automatically generated.
The network name will be based on the name of your computer. Other devices
will need this information to connect to the hotspot you've just created.</p>
