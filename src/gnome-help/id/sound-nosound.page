<title>Saya tak bisa mendengar suara apapun pada komputer</title>

  <p>If you can't hear any sounds on your computer, for example when you try to
 play music, try these troubleshooting steps to see if you can fix the problem.</p>

<section id="mute">
 <title>Make sure that the sound is not muted</title>
 <p>Click the sound icon on the top bar (it looks like a speaker) and make sure
 that the sound is not muted or turned right down.</p>
 <p>Some laptops have mute switches or keys on their keyboards—try pressing
 that key to see if it unmutes the sound.</p>
 <p>You should also check that you haven't muted the application that you're
 using to play sound (e.g. your music player or movie player). The application
 may have a mute or volume button in its main window, so check that. Also, click
 the sound icon on the top bar and choose <gui>Sound Settings</gui>. When the
 <gui>Sound</gui> window appears, go to the <gui>Applications</gui> tab and
 check that your application is not muted.</p>
</section>

<section id="speakers">
 <title>Check that the speakers are turned on and connected properly</title>
 <p>If your computer has external speakers, make sure that they are turned on
 and that the volume is turned up. Make sure that the speaker cable is securely
 plugged into the "output" audio socket on the back of the computer. This socket
 is usually light green in color.</p>

 <p>Some sound cards are able to switch which socket they use for output (to the
 speakers) and input (from a microphone, for instance). The output socket may be
 different when running Linux than on Windows or Mac OS. Try connecting the
 speaker cable to the different audio sockets on the computer in turn to see if
 that works.</p>

 <p>Hal terakhir untuk diperiksa adalah bahwa kabel audio tertancap dengan baik di belakang speaker. Beberapa speaker memiliki lebih dari satu masukan juga.</p>
</section>

<section id="device">
 <title>Check that the right sound device is selected</title>
 <p>Some computers have multiple "sound devices" installed. Some of these are
 capable of outputting sound and some are not, so you should check that you have
 the correct one selected. This might involve some trial-and-error to choose the
 right one.</p>
 <steps>
  <item>
   <p>Klik ikon suara pada bilah puncak dan pilih <gui>Pengaturan Suara</gui>.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
   <p>In the <gui>Sound</gui> window that appears, go to the <gui>Output</gui>
 tab. Make a note of which device and which profile are selected (so you can
 return to the default selections if changing them doesn't work).</p>
  </item>
  <item>
   <p>For the selected device, try changing the profile—play a sound after you
 change the profile to see if it works. You might need to go through the list
 and try each profile.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
   <p>If that doesn't work, you might want to try doing the same for any other
 devices that are listed.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
   <p>Try changing the <gui>Connector</gui> option in the <gui>Output</gui> tab.</p>
  </item>
 </steps>
</section>

<section id="hardware-detected">
 <title>Periksalah bahwa kartu suara terdeteksi dengan benar</title>
 <p>Kartu suara Anda mungkin belum terdeteksi secara benar. Bila ini terjadi, komputer Anda akan mengira bahwa dia tak dapat membunyikan suara. Alasan yang mungkin mengapa kartu tak terdeteksi secara benar adalah karena penggerak bagi kartu tak terpasang.</p>
 <steps>
  <item>
   <p>Ke ringkasan <gui>Aktivitas</gui> dan buka suatu Terminal.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
   <p>Ketikkan <cmd>aplay -l</cmd> dan tekan <key>Enter</key>.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
   <p>Daftar perangkat akan ditunjukkan. Bila tak ada <gui>perangkat keras pemutar</gui>, berarti kartu suara Anda belum terdeteksi.</p>
  </item>
 </steps>

 <p>If your sound card is not detected, you may need to manually install the
 drivers for it. How you do this will depend on the card you have.</p>

 <p>You can see what sound card you have by using the <cmd>lspci</cmd> command
 in the Terminal. You may have to run <cmd>lspci</cmd> as
 <link xref="user-admin-explain">superuser</link>; either type <cmd>sudo lspci</cmd>
 and type your password, or type <cmd>su</cmd>, enter the <em>root</em>
 (administrative) password, then type <cmd>lspci</cmd>. See if an
 <em>audio controller</em> or <em>audio device</em> is listed—it should have the
 sound card's make and model number. <cmd>lspci -v</cmd> will show a list with
 more detailed information.</p>

 <p>You may be able to find and install drivers for your card. It's best to ask
 on support forums (or otherwise) for your Linux distribution for instructions.</p>

 <p>If you can't get drivers for your sound card, you might prefer to buy a new
 sound card. You can get sound cards that can be installed inside the computer
 and external USB sound cards.</p>
