  <p>GSettings overrides are used by distributions to adjust default settings
  for the GNOME desktop and apps. dconf overrides were designed for system
  administrators to adjust default settings and set mandatory settings for the
  GNOME desktop and apps.</p>

   <p>GNOME developers are working towards allowing or even requiring <file>/usr/</file>
   to be mounted read-only with the exception of <file>/usr/local/</file>.</p>

   <p>Default values are defined in the schemas that get installed by an
   application. Sometimes, it is necessary for a vendor or distributor to adjust
   these defaults. Since patching the XML source for the schema is inconvenient
   and error-prone, glib-compile-schemas reads so-called
   <em>"vendor override"</em>  files. These are keyfiles in the same directory
   as the XML schema sources which can override default values. The schema id
   serves as the group name in the key file, and the values are expected in
   serialized GVariant form, as in the following example:</p>

<code>
[org.gtk.Example]
key1='string'
key2=1.5
</code>
